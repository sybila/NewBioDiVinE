Distributed MAP
===============

The MAP algorithm computes the maximal accepting predecessors of all states
to detect an accepting cycle. Algorithm works in iterations separated by
synchronizations of workstations. Algorithm allows to change type of state
space search and ordering of states (to compute _maximal_ accepting
predecessor).
