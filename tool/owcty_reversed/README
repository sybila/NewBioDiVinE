OWCTY reversed
--------------

Algorithm computes maximal set of states satisying property:
"there is an accepting cycle reachable from me". If the set is non-empty 
in the end, then the presence of reachable accepting cycle is ensured.
A state is eliminated from the set according these two rules:
1) there is no immediate successor remaining in the set,
2) there is no (not necessary immediate) accepting successor in the set.

Algorithm shows similar behaviour compared to simsym (OWCTY) algorithm.  
This is because it behaves exactly like the OWCTY algorithm on graph with
reversed edges. However, to be able to perform so, it needs to reverse
(hence store) edges in the graph. That is why the algorithm suffer from
higher memory requirements compared to other algorithms. Formal
description of the algorithm is comming soon. In case of interest in very
details, feel free to ask Jiri Barnat (barnat@fi.muni.cz).
