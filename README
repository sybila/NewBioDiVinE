This is the package containing BioDiVinE-1.1 tool (including DiVinE/Library and DiVinE/ToolSet.)

This branch of DiVinE focuses on modeling and analysis of dynamic models of biological systems
including sigmoidal switches and Hill functions, that are transformed into ramp functions
by piece-wise multi-affine abstraction.

Currently this is an experimental branch of DiVinE that includes the basic kernel 
of DiVinE (the DiVinE library) which extended with state-space generator for biological 
systems.
